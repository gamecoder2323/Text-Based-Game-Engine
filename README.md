# Text-Based-Game-Engine
Create your own text-based adventure game! (in-development)

In this program, you are allowed to make your own text-based games. At the moment, it can only recognize 2-word commands: they are in
the form of "(verb) (noun)." So, for example, "go north" would execute a function for when the user types "go," and then "north." It does
this by parsing the text at the space, which splits the input into verb and noun, and then returning a specific enum type for that word,
and any syllables you define. Some of the processes are a little complicated to work with at the moment, but it works! For the time being,
the instructions are located at the top of the file "Game.cpp." It is a fairly small program, so explore it! Because this was just a
"For fun" project, I didn't exactly optimize the code to be used by others. It comes with a VERY basic, and incomplete game. Be sure to
take a look at Game.h for specific class types that you need to initiate the game if you would like to start from scratch.

Use at your own risk! (Written in C++)
